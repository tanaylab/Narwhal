# Narwhal - NFS Read/Write Locks

Provides (hopefully robust) read/write locks between distributed processes using shared NFS storage. This is just a
single `.h` file and a single `.c` file you can just drop into your project. It is implemented in C99. See the header
file for the API and detailed documentation. Usage is "simple":

```c
#include <narwhal.h>

narwhal = Narwhal {
        .lockdir = "/some/path/to/lockdir",
        .spin_usec = 1000,
        .timeout_sec = 10
};

narwhal_read_lock(&narwhal)
read_protected_data()
narwhal_unlock(&narwhal)

narwhal_write_lock(&narwhal)
read_protected_data()
write_updated_data()
narwhal_unlock(&narwhal)
```
